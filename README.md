### Credit
The [OSR website](https://ohbm.github.io/osr2026) was built using the [Beautiful Jekyll](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) theme by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/).


#### Instructions for building website (these must be run prior to uploading onto GH)
+ Check the speaker/volunteer CSV files are in place (in _data/speakers, _data/volunteers)
Wipe the built directories if they already exist, and re-build: 
`rm -r _speakers _volunteers; bundle exec jekyll pagemaster speakers volunteers`
Commit the new directories and push the site. This must be done every time the CSV files are changed. 

+ If `bundle exec` error out, do the following things:

    1. Create Gemfile
    2. Follow the errors and add all required dependencies
    3. Run `bundle install`

##### Docker alternative

To avoid installing Ruby and all dependencies on your local machine, you can use Docker to build and serve the site. Run the following command in the root of the repository:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 \
  -v "$PWD":/site -w /site \
  ruby:3.2 bash -lc \
  "bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0"
```
